        <p>Andy graduated from Sheridan College with the Bachelor of Animation with focus on 3D.  
           The 3D aspect gave me great exposure to tools such as python and maya embeeded language to kickstart my career in the security field.  I am very enthusiastic about Identity Access Management and enjoy navigating through solutions that can mitigate and protect organizations and the people it serves.  </p>
