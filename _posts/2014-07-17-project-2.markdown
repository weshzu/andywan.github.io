description: ESCALATED.  The email domain is a very deceiving one mixed with randomly generated letters and numbers.  Additionally, the grammar of the role interest is very unclear and seems to have no effort to display any form of real interest in the role as an "Infrastructure engineer".  A password attached in the body email for protection of his/her resume seems very suspicious.  The attachment file name is called “bfsvc.exe” and seems to have garnered some known malicious file risk revolving with the content that was left for the recipient to open.  Escalated because it does in fact have malicious content within the email.
